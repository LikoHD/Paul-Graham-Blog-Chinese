      "Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. March 2009A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down to two words: relentlessly resourceful.Till then the best I'd managed was to get the opposite quality down to one: hapless.",
      "Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky. But the dictionaries are not doing a very good job. A team that outplays its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee could be called unlucky, but not hapless.",
      "Hapless implies passivity. To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances — to let the world have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world. [1]Unfortunately there's no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult to tell founders what to aim for.",
      "\"Don't be hapless\" is not much of a rallying cry.It's not hard to express the quality we're looking for in metaphors. The best is probably a running back. A good running back is not merely determined, but flexible as well.",
      "They want to get downfield, but they adapt their plans on the fly.Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most people outside the US. \"Be like a running back\" is no better than \"Don't be hapless.\"But finally I've figured out how to express this quality directly.",
      "I was writing a talk for investors, and I had to explain what to look for in founders. What would someone who was the opposite of hapless be like? They'd be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely relentless.",
      "That's not enough to make things go your way except in a few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting domain, the difficulties will be novel. Which means you can't simply plow through them, because you don't know initially how hard they are; you don't know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam or granite.",
      "So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep trying new things.Be relentlessly resourceful.That sounds right, but is it simply a description of how to be successful in general? I don't think so. This isn't the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example.",
      "In that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious. Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly internal; the obstacle is your own obtuseness.",
      "[2]There probably are other fields where \"relentlessly resourceful\" is the recipe for success. But though other fields may share it, I think this is the best short description we'll find of what makes a good startup founder.",
      "I doubt it could be made more precise.Now that we know what we're looking for, that leads to other questions. For example, can this quality be taught? After four years of trying to teach it to people, I'd say that yes, surprisingly often it can.",
      "Not to everyone, but to many people. [3] Some people are just constitutionally passive, but others have a latent ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be brought out.This is particularly true of young people who have till now always been under the thumb of some kind of authority.",
      "Being relentlessly resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies, or in most schools. I don't even want to think what the recipe is in big companies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving some combination of resourcefulness, obedience, and building alliances.Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a question people often wonder about: how many startups there could be.",
      "There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic upper bound on this number. There's no reason to believe there is any limit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb, any more than there is a limit on the number of theorems that can be proven.",
      "So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups is the pool of potential founders. Some people would make good founders, and others wouldn't. And now that we can say what makes a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of the pool.This test is also useful to individuals.",
      "If you want to know whether you're the right sort of person to start a startup, ask yourself whether you're relentlessly resourceful. And if you want to know whether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if they are.You can even use it tactically.",
      "If I were running a startup, this would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror. \"Make something people want\" is the destination, but \"Be relentlessly resourceful\" is how you get there. Notes[1] I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the meaning of the word has shifted.",
      "No one writing a dictionary from scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky. But a couple hundred years ago they might have. People were more at the mercy of circumstances in the past, and as a result a lot of the words we use for good and bad outcomes have origins in words about luck.When I was living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone that I hadn't had much success in doing something, but I couldn't think of the Italian word for success.",
      "I spent some time trying to describe the word I meant. Finally she said \"Ah! Fortuna!\"[2] There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be actively curious. There can be times when what you're doing is almost pure discovery.",
      "Unfortunately these times are a small proportion of the whole. On the other hand, they are in research too.[3] I'd almost say to most people, but I realize (a) I have no idea what most people are like, and (b) I'm pathologically optimistic about people's ability to change.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this."

      "translated": "想创业吗？获取 Y Combinator 的资金支持。2009 年 3 月，几天前，我终于将成为一名优秀的创业创始人归结为两个词：百折不挠，善于利用资源。在此之前，我最多只能用一个词来形容相反的特质：无助。"

      "translated": "不幸意味着被动。不幸的人是被环境所左右的——任由世界摆布，而不是掌控世界。[1]不幸的是，没有“不幸”的反义词，这使得很难告诉创业者他们应该追求什么。"

      "translated": "这还不足以让你在大多数领域如愿以偿，除非是在一些大多乏味的领域。在任何有趣的领域，困难都会是全新的。这意味着你不能简单地硬闯过去，因为你最初并不知道这些困难有多难；你不知道自己即将穿越的是泡沫块还是花岗岩。"

      "translated": "所以你必须善于利用资源。你必须不断尝试新事物。要不屈不挠地善于利用资源。这听起来没错，但这仅仅是对如何取得成功的一般性描述吗？我不这么认为。这并不是写作或绘画成功的方法。"

      "translated": "不是对所有人，但对许多人来说是这样的。[3] 有些人天生就是被动的，但另一些人则具有一种潜在的能力，只需激发就能表现出不屈不挠的创造力。这在年轻人身上尤为明显，他们至今一直生活在某种权威的掌控之下。"

      "translated": "在大公司或大多数学校里，坚持不懈地发挥资源创造力绝不是成功的秘诀。我甚至不想去想大公司的成功秘诀是什么，但可以肯定的是，这一定更加复杂和混乱，涉及资源创造力、服从性和建立联盟的某种组合。识别这一品质也使我们更接近于回答人们经常关注的一个问题：可能有多少初创企业。"

And now that we can say what makes a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of the pool.This test is also useful to individuals.",
      "translated": "因此，初创企业的数量可能受限于潜在创始人的数量。有些人适合成为创始人，而有些人则不适合。现在我们能够定义一个好创始人应具备的特质，也就能够对潜在创始人池的规模设定一个上限。这一标准对个人也很有帮助。"

      "translated": "如果你想知道自己是否是适合创业的人，问问自己是否具有不屈不挠的资源获取能力。如果你想知道是否要招募某人作为联合创始人，也问一问他们是否具备这种能力。你甚至可以将此作为策略性考量。"

      "translated": "如果我经营一家初创公司，这句话我会贴在镜子上：“做出人们想要的东西”是目标，但“不遗余力地寻找资源”是实现这一目标的方法。我认为词典的定义之所以不准确，是因为这个词的意义已经发生了变化。"

      "translated": "如今，没有人从头编写词典时会说“hapless”意为不幸的。但几百年前，他们可能会这样认为。过去的人们更受制于环境，因此我们用来表示好结果和坏结果的许多词汇都起源于与运气有关的词语。当我住在意大利时，有一次我试图告诉某人我在做某事上没有取得多大成功，但我却想不起意大利语中“成功”的单词。"
