      "October 2015Here's a simple trick for getting more people to read what you write: write in spoken language.Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write in a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a friend.",
      "The sentence structure and even the words are different. No one uses \"pen\" as a verb in spoken English. You'd feel like an idiot using \"pen\" instead of \"write\" in a conversation with a friend.The last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago: The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: \"After Altamira, all is decadence.\" It's from Neil Oliver's A History of Ancient Britain.",
      "I feel bad making an example of this book, because it's no worse than lots of others. But just imagine calling Picasso \"the mercurial Spaniard\" when talking to a friend. Even one sentence of this would raise eyebrows in conversation.",
      "And yet people write whole books of it.Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make written language worse?If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes. Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read.",
      "It's also more formal and distant, which gives the reader's attention permission to drift. But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that you're saying more than you actually are.You don't need complex sentences to express complex ideas.",
      "When specialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas in their field, they don't use sentences any more complex than they do when talking about what to have for lunch. They use different words, certainly.",
      "But even those they use no more than necessary. And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove, and partly because the harder the ideas you're talking about, the less you can afford to let language get in the way.Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.I'm not saying spoken language always works best.",
      "Poetry is as much music as text, so you can say things you wouldn't say in conversation. And there are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancy language in prose. And then of course there are cases where writers don't want to make it easy to understand what they're saying—in corporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the more bogus end of the humanities.",
      "But for nearly everyone else, spoken language is better.It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language. So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask \"Is this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?\" If it isn't, imagine what you would say, and use that instead.",
      "After a while this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write something you wouldn't say, you'll hear the clank as it hits the page.Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything that doesn't sound like conversation.",
      "I even fix bits that are phonetically awkward; I don't know if that's necessary, but it doesn't cost much.This trick may not always be enough. I've seen writing so far removed from spoken language that it couldn't be fixed sentence by sentence.",
      "For cases like that there's a more drastic solution. After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you just wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking.",
      "The fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely people manage to write in spoken language. Otherwise everyone's writing would sound like them talking.If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you'll be ahead of 95% of writers.",
      "And it's so easy to do: just don't let a sentence through unless it's the way you'd say it to a friend.Thanks to Patrick Collison and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.Japanese TranslationArabic Translation"

      "translated": "2015年10月这里有一个简单的技巧，可以让你写的东西吸引更多读者：用口语化的语言来写作。大多数人在开始写作时都会发生一种变化，他们使用的语言与跟朋友交谈时使用的完全不同。"

      "translated": "句子结构甚至词汇都不同。没有人会在口语中把“pen”用作动词。如果你在和朋友的对话中用“pen”代替“write”，你会觉得自己像个傻瓜。对我来说，最后一根稻草是几天前读到的一句话：“那位多变的西班牙人自己宣布：‘在阿尔塔米拉之后，一切皆为衰败。’”这句话出自尼尔·奥利弗的《古代不列颠史》。"

      "translated": "我觉得拿这本书举例有点过意不去，因为它的水平并不比其他许多书差。但试想一下，如果你在和朋友聊天时称呼毕加索为“那位善变的西班牙人”，即使只有一句话，也会让人感到奇怪。"

      "translated": "然而，人们还是会写出整本书来。好吧，书面语言和口语确实不同。这是否意味着书面语言更差？如果你希望人们能读得懂你写的东西，那确实如此。书面语言更为复杂，这使得阅读它更加费力。"

      "translated": "这也会显得更加正式和疏远，从而让读者的注意力容易游离。但最糟糕的是，复杂的句子和华丽的词汇会给你，作为作者，一种错误的印象，即你表述的内容比实际要丰富得多。你并不需要复杂的句子来表达复杂的思想。"

      "translated": "诗歌既是音乐也是文字，因此可以表达在日常对话中不会说出的内容。有些作家在散文中使用华丽的语言也能让人接受。当然，还有一些情况下，作家并不希望读者轻易理解他们的意思——比如在公司宣布坏消息时，或者在人文科学中较为虚伪的一端。"

      "translated": "但对几乎所有人来说，口语更好。大多数人似乎很难用口语来写作。所以，也许最好的解决办法是先按照你通常的方式写第一稿，然后回过头来看每一句话，问自己：“如果我是在和朋友说话，我会这么说吗？”如果不会，就想象你会怎么说，然后用那个说法。"

      "translated": "我甚至会修正那些发音不顺的词；我不知道这样做是否必要，但这样做并不会花费太多。这个技巧并不总是足够。我见过一些写作，与口语相差甚远，以至于不能一句一句地修正。"
