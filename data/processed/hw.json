      "Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. October 2012One advantage of Y Combinator's early, broad focus is that we see trends before most other people. And one of the most conspicuous trends in the last batch was the large number of hardware startups.",
      "Out of 84 companies, 7 were making hardware. On the whole they've done better than the companies that weren't.They've faced resistance from investors of course. Investors have a deep-seated bias against hardware.",
      "But investors' opinions are a trailing indicator. The best founders are better at seeing the future than the best investors, because the best founders are making it.There is no one single force driving this trend.",
      "Hardware does well on crowdfunding sites. The spread of tablets makes it possible to build new things controlled by and even incorporating them. Electric motors have improved. Wireless connectivity of various types can now be taken for granted.",
      "It's getting more straightforward to get things manufactured. Arduinos, 3D printing, laser cutters, and more accessible CNC milling are making hardware easier to prototype. Retailers are less of a bottleneck as customers increasingly buy online.One question I can answer is why hardware is suddenly cool.",
      "It always was cool. Physical things are great. They just haven't been as great a way to start a rapidly growing business as software. But that rule may not be permanent. It's not even that old; it only dates from about 1990.",
      "Maybe the advantage of software will turn out to have been temporary. Hackers love to build hardware, and customers love to buy it. So if the ease of shipping hardware even approached the ease of shipping software, we'd see a lot more hardware startups.It wouldn't be the first time something was a bad idea till it wasn't.",
      "And it wouldn't be the first time investors learned that lesson from founders.So if you want to work on hardware, don't be deterred from doing it because you worry investors will discriminate against you.",
      "And in particular, don't be deterred from applying to Y Combinator with a hardware idea, because we're especially interested in hardware startups.We know there's room for the next Steve Jobs. But there's almost certainly also room for the first <Your Name Here>.",

      "translated": "想创业吗？那就获得Y Combinator的资助吧。2012年10月Y Combinator早期广泛的关注点之一优势是，我们比大多数人更早地看到趋势。而在最近一批项目中，最明显的一个趋势就是大量硬件创业公司的出现。"

      "translated": "在84家公司中，有7家在制造硬件。总体而言，它们的表现优于那些不制造硬件的公司。当然，它们也遇到了来自投资者的阻力。投资者对硬件有着根深蒂固的偏见。"

      "translated": "制造东西变得越来越简单。Arduino、3D打印、激光切割机和更易使用的CNC铣床使得硬件原型制作更加容易。随着客户越来越多地在线购买，零售商的瓶颈作用也在减弱。我可以回答的一个问题是，为什么硬件突然变得很酷。"

      "translated": "它一直都很酷。实体事物很棒。只是它们并没有像软件那样成为迅速扩展业务的良好起点。但这一规则可能并不是永恒的。事实上，它甚至并不算老；这一规则只可以追溯到大约1990年。"

      "translated": "也许软件的优势将证明是暂时的。黑客喜欢制造硬件，而客户喜欢购买硬件。因此，如果硬件的交付变得像软件一样容易，我们将看到更多的硬件初创公司。这不会是第一次某个想法从不好变为好。"
