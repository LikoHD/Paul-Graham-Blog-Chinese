      "translated": "2009年4月，我通常避免谈论政治，但既然我们现在似乎有一个乐于接受建议的政府，我决定冒个险提一个建议。政府能够做的、以增加本国初创公司数量的最有效的事情是一项无需花费任何成本的政策：为初创公司的创始人设立一个新的签证类别。制约美国新创公司数量增长的最大因素并非税收政策、劳动法，甚至也不是萨班斯-奥克斯利法案。"

      "translated": "我们不会让那些想在这里创业的人进入国家。每年允许1万名创业创始人进入国家，可能会对经济产生明显的影响。如果我们假设每个创业公司有4个人，这可能是一个高估，那么就是2500家新公司。"

      "translated": "每年，他们中不会全部成长为像谷歌那样的大公司，但在2500家公司中，有一些会接近这个水平。根据定义，这10000名创始人不会抢走美国人的工作：签证的条件可以规定他们只能为其自己创立的新公司工作，而不能为现有公司工作。"
