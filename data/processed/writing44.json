      "March 2005 (In the process of answering an email, I accidentally wrote a tiny essay about writing. I usually spend weeks on an essay. This one took 67 minutes—23 of writing, and 44 of rewriting.)I think it's far more important to write well than most people realize.",
      "Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them. If you're bad at writing and don't like to do it, you'll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated.As for how to write well, here's the short version: Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut out everything unnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate writers you like; if you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said; expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong; be confident enough to cut; have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which bits are confusing or drag; don't (always) make detailed outlines; mull ideas over for a few days before writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you; start writing when you think of the first sentence; if a deadline forces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence first; write about stuff you like; don't try to sound impressive; don't hesitate to change the topic on the fly; use footnotes to contain digressions; use anaphora to knit sentences together; read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the paragraphs you dread reading); try to tell the reader something new and useful; work in fairly big quanta of time; when you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with; accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don't feel obliged to cover any of them; write for a reader who won't read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are designed to sound ok on crappy car radios; if you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately; ask friends which sentence you'll regret most; go back and tone down harsh remarks; publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas; print out drafts instead of just looking at them on the screen; use simple, germanic words; learn to distinguish surprises from digressions; learn to recognize the approach of an ending, and when one appears, grab it.Russian TranslationJapanese TranslationRomanian TranslationSpanish TranslationGerman TranslationChinese TranslationHungarian TranslationCatalan TranslationDanish TranslationArabic Translation"

      "translated": "写作不仅传达思想，还能生成思想。如果你的写作水平很差，又不喜欢写作，你就会错过写作本可以生成的大部分思想。关于如何写好文章，以下是简短的版本：尽快写出一个粗糙的初稿；反复修改；删掉所有不必要的内容；用对话的语气写作；培养对劣质写作的敏感度，以便能够发现并修正自己文章中的问题；模仿你喜欢的作家；如果你不知道如何开始，告诉某人你打算写什么，然后写下你说过的话；预计文章80%的思想是在开始写作之后产生的，而你最初的想法中有50%可能是错误的；有足够的自信进行删减；让信任的朋友阅读你的作品，并指出哪些部分令人困惑或拖沓；不要（总是）做详细的提纲；在写作前花几天时间思考想法；随身携带一个小笔记本或废纸；当你想到第一句话时开始写作；如果截止日期迫使你在此之前开始，先说出最重要的句子；写你喜欢的东西；不要试图给人留下深刻印象；不要犹豫在写作过程中改变主题；使用脚注来包含旁白；使用重复来连接句子；大声朗读你的文章，看看（a）你在哪些尴尬的短语上磕磕绊绊，以及（b）哪些部分令人厌倦（你不愿意阅读的段落）；尽量告诉读者一些新的和有用的东西；在相当大的时间单位中工作；重新开始时，先重读你目前写的内容；完成时，给自己留一些容易开始的内容；在文件底部积累你计划涵盖的主题的笔记；不要觉得有义务涵盖所有这些；为一个不会像你那样仔细阅读文章的读者写作，就像流行歌曲被设计成在糟糕的汽车收音机上听起来也不错一样；如果你说错了什么，立即改正；问朋友你最可能后悔哪一句话；回头缓和严厉的评论；在线发布作品，因为受众会让你写作更多，从而产生更多的思想；打印草稿而不仅仅是用屏幕查看；使用简单的日耳曼词汇；学会区分惊喜和旁白；学会识别结尾的到来，当它出现时，抓住它。"
