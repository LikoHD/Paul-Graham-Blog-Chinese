      "March 2006, rev August 2009Yesterday one of the founders we funded asked me why we started Y Combinator. Or more precisely, he asked if we'd started YC mainly for fun.Kind of, but not quite. It is enormously fun to be able to work with Rtm and Trevor again.",
      "I missed that after we sold Viaweb, and for all the years after I always had a background process running, looking for something we could do together. There is definitely an aspect of a band reunion to Y Combinator.",
      "Every couple days I slip and call it \"Viaweb.\"Viaweb we started very explicitly to make money. I was sick of living from one freelance project to the next, and decided to just work as hard as I could till I'd made enough to solve the problem once and for all.",
      "Viaweb was sometimes fun, but it wasn't designed for fun, and mostly it wasn't. I'd be surprised if any startup is. All startups are mostly schleps.The real reason we started Y Combinator is neither selfish nor virtuous.",
      "We didn't start it mainly to make money; we have no idea what our average returns might be, and won't know for years. Nor did we start YC mainly to help out young would-be founders, though we do like the idea, and comfort ourselves occasionally with the thought that if all our investments tank, we will thus have been doing something unselfish.",
      "(It's oddly nondeterministic.)The real reason we started Y Combinator is one probably only a hacker would understand. We did it because it seems such a great hack. There are thousands of smart people who could start companies and don't, and with a relatively small amount of force applied at just the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of new startups that might otherwise not have existed.In a way this is virtuous, because I think startups are a good thing.",
      "But really what motivates us is the completely amoral desire that would motivate any hacker who looked at some complex device and realized that with a tiny tweak he could make it run more efficiently.",
      "In this case, the device is the world's economy, which fortunately happens to be open source."

      "translated": "每隔几天我就会不小心叫它“Viaweb”。我们创立Viaweb的目的非常明确，就是为了赚钱。我厌倦了靠一个又一个的自由职业项目过活，决定拼命工作，直到赚到足以一劳永逸地解决这个问题的钱。"

      "translated": "Viaweb 有时很有趣，但它并不是为了有趣而设计的，大部分时候并不有趣。我会感到惊讶如果有什么初创公司是有趣的。所有初创公司大部分时间都是辛苦的工作。我们创立 Y Combinator 的真正原因既不是自私的，也不是高尚的。"

      "translated": "我们并不是主要为了赚钱而开始这项事业的；我们不知道平均回报率会是多少，而且几年内都不会知道。我们创办YC也不是主要为了帮助年轻的创业者，尽管我们喜欢这个想法，并且偶尔会用这样的念头来安慰自己：即使我们所有的投资都失败了，至少我们做了一件无私的事情。"
