      "May 2021Most people think of nerds as quiet, diffident people. In ordinary social situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star quarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics symposium.",
      "And for the same reason: they are fish out of water. But the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact that when non-nerds observe them, it's usually in ordinary social situations. In fact some nerds are quite fierce.The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group.",
      "They are as a rule extremely competitive — more competitive, I'd say, than highly competitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly perhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance themselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the kinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified in taking the results personally.Fierce nerds also tend to be somewhat overconfident, especially when young.",
      "It might seem like it would be a disadvantage to be mistaken about one's abilities, but empirically it isn't. Up to a point, confidence is a self-fullfilling prophecy.Another quality you find in most fierce nerds is intelligence.",
      "Not all nerds are smart, but the fierce ones are always at least moderately so. If they weren't, they wouldn't have the confidence to be fierce. [1]There's also a natural connection between nerdiness and independent-mindedness.",
      "It's hard to be independent-minded without being somewhat socially awkward, because conventional beliefs are so often mistaken, or at least arbitrary. No one who was both independent-minded and ambitious would want to waste the effort it takes to fit in.",
      "And the independent-mindedness of the fierce nerds will obviously be of the aggressive rather than the passive type: they'll be annoyed by rules, rather than dreamily unaware of them.I'm less sure why fierce nerds are impatient, but most seem to be.",
      "You notice it first in conversation, where they tend to interrupt you. This is merely annoying, but in the more promising fierce nerds it's connected to a deeper impatience about solving problems. Perhaps the competitiveness and impatience of fierce nerds are not separate qualities, but two manifestations of a single underlying drivenness.When you combine all these qualities in sufficient quantities, the result is quite formidable.",
      "The most vivid example of fierce nerds in action may be James Watson's The Double Helix. The first sentence of the book is \"I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood,\" and the portrait he goes on to paint of Crick is the quintessential fierce nerd: brilliant, socially awkward, competitive, independent-minded, overconfident.",
      "But so is the implicit portrait he paints of himself. Indeed, his lack of social awareness makes both portraits that much more realistic, because he baldly states all sorts of opinions and motivations that a smoother person would conceal.",
      "And moreover it's clear from the story that Crick and Watson's fierce nerdiness was integral to their success. Their independent-mindedness caused them to consider approaches that most others ignored, their overconfidence allowed them to work on problems they only half understood (they were literally described as \"clowns\" by one eminent insider), and their impatience and competitiveness got them to the answer ahead of two other groups that would otherwise have found it within the next year, if not the next several months.",
      "[2]The idea that there could be fierce nerds is an unfamiliar one not just to many normal people but even to some young nerds. Especially early on, nerds spend so much of their time in ordinary social situations and so little doing real work that they get a lot more evidence of their awkwardness than their power.",
      "So there will be some who read this description of the fierce nerd and realize \"Hmm, that's me.\" And it is to you, young fierce nerd, that I now turn.I have some good news, and some bad news. The good news is that your fierceness will be a great help in solving difficult problems.",
      "And not just the kind of scientific and technical problems that nerds have traditionally solved. As the world progresses, the number of things you can win at by getting the right answer increases. Recently getting rich became one of them: 7 of the 8 richest people in America are now fierce nerds.Indeed, being a fierce nerd is probably even more helpful in business than in nerds' original territory of scholarship.",
      "Fierceness seems optional there. Darwin for example doesn't seem to have been especially fierce. Whereas it's impossible to be the CEO of a company over a certain size without being fierce, so now that nerds can win at business, fierce nerds will increasingly monopolize the really big successes.The bad news is that if it's not exercised, your fierceness will turn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playground bully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the hater, the shooter down of new ideas.How do you avoid this fate?",
      "Work on ambitious projects. If you succeed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizes bitterness. But you don't need to have succeeded to feel this; merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds some feeling of satisfaction.",
      "And those it doesn't, it at least keeps busy. [3]Another solution may be to somehow turn off your fierceness, by devoting yourself to meditation or psychotherapy or something like that. Maybe that's the right answer for some people.",
      "I have no idea. But it doesn't seem the optimal solution to me. If you're given a sharp knife, it seems to me better to use it than to blunt its edge to avoid cutting yourself.If you do choose the ambitious route, you'll have a tailwind behind you.",
      "There has never been a better time to be a nerd. In the past century we've seen a continuous transfer of power from dealmakers to technicians — from the charismatic to the competent — and I don't see anything on the horizon that will end it.",
      "At least not till the nerds end it themselves by bringing about the singularity.Notes[1] To be a nerd is to be socially awkward, and there are two distinct ways to do that: to be playing the same game as everyone else, but badly, and to be playing a different game.",
      "The smart nerds are the latter type.[2] The same qualities that make fierce nerds so effective can also make them very annoying. Fierce nerds would do well to remember this, and (a) try to keep a lid on it, and (b) seek out organizations and types of work where getting the right answer matters more than preserving social harmony.",
      "In practice that means small groups working on hard problems. Which fortunately is the most fun kind of environment anyway.[3] If success neutralizes bitterness, why are there some people who are at least moderately successful and yet still quite bitter?",
      "Because people's potential bitterness varies depending on how naturally bitter their personality is, and how ambitious they are: someone who's naturally very bitter will still have a lot left after success neutralizes some of it, and someone who's very ambitious will need proportionally more success to satisfy that ambition.So the worst-case scenario is someone who's both naturally bitter and extremely ambitious, and yet only moderately successful.",

      "translated": "出于同样的原因：他们像鱼儿离开了水。但书呆子表面上的怯懦其实是一种错觉，因为当非书呆子观察他们时，通常是在普通的社交场合。事实上，有些书呆子相当凶猛。这些凶猛的书呆子虽然人数不多，却是一个有趣的群体。"

      "translated": "他们通常极具竞争力——我认为，比那些极具竞争力的非书呆子更加竞争激烈。对他们来说，竞争更加个人化。部分原因可能是他们情感上还不够成熟，无法与竞争保持距离，但另一个原因是他们参与的竞争类型中随机性较少，因此他们更有理由将结果视为个人的。激烈的书呆子还往往有些过于自信，尤其是在年轻的时候。"

      "translated": "你首先会在对话中注意到这一点，他们往往会打断你。这仅仅是令人烦恼，但在那些更有潜力的激烈书呆子身上，这种行为与更深层次的解决问题的不耐烦有关。也许，激烈书呆子的竞争性和不耐烦并不是独立的特质，而是单一内在驱动力的两种表现。当这些特质以足够的量结合在一起时，其结果相当 formidable（ formidable 在这里可以译为“ formidable ”，但为了更自然的表达，可以译为“强大”）。"

      "translated": "最生动的例子可能是詹姆斯·沃森的《双螺旋》。这本书的开头是：“我从未见过弗朗西斯·克里克有谦逊的时候”，随后他对克里克的描绘堪称典型的强硬书呆子：才华横溢、社交笨拙、竞争激烈、思想独立、自信过头。"

      "translated": "此外，从这个故事中可以明显看出，克里克和沃森的强烈书生气是他们成功的关键。他们的独立思考使他们考虑了大多数其他人忽视的方法，他们的过度自信使他们能够在只懂一半的问题上进行研究（一位著名的内部人士实际上称他们为“小丑”），而他们的急躁和竞争意识使他们比另外两个小组更早找到了答案，否则这些小组可能在接下来的一年，甚至几个月内就会发现。"
