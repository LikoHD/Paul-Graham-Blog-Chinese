      "March 2011Yesterday Fred Wilson published a remarkable post about missing Airbnb. VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward.",
      "So that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is. He's probably the nicest VC I know.Reading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb.",
      "It was quite interesting to read. You can see Fred's mind at work as he circles the deal.Fred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part of the conversation).",
      "It's an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't seen it.",
      "The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the time.We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits.",
      "I don't always try as hard as this though. Fred must have found me quite annoying. from: Paul Graham to: Fred Wilson, AirBedAndBreakfast Founders date: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:42 AM subject: meet the airbedsOne of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast, is in NYC right now meeting their users.",
      "(NYC is their biggest market.) I'd recommend meeting them if your schedule allows.I'd been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to do really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would never go for it.",
      "But then I thought maybe I should give you more credit. You'll certainly like meeting them. Be sure to ask about how they funded themselves with breakfast cereal.There's no reason this couldn't be as big as Ebay.",
      "And this team is the right one to do it.--pgfrom: Brian Chesky to: Paul Graham cc: Nathan Blecharczyk, Joe Gebbia date: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:40 AM subject: Re: meet the airbedsPG,Thanks for the intro!Brianfrom: Paul Graham to: Brian Chesky cc: Nathan Blecharczyk, Joe Gebbia date: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 12:38 PM subject: Re: meet the airbedsIt's a longshot, at this stage, but if there was any VC who'd get you guys, it would be Fred.",

      "Practically every really big startup could say, five years later, \"believe it or not, we started out doing ___.\" It just seemed a very good sign to me that these guys were actually on the ground in NYC hunting down (and understanding) their users.",
      "On top of several previous good signs.--pgfrom: Fred Wilson to: Paul Graham date: Sun, Feb 1, 2009 at 7:15 AM subject: Re: meet the airbedsIt's interestingOur two junior team members were enthusiasticThe three \"old guys\" didn't get itfrom: Paul Graham to: Fred Wilson date: Mon, Feb 9, 2009 at 5:58 PM subject: airbnbThe Airbeds just won the first poll among all the YC startups in their batch by a landslide.",
