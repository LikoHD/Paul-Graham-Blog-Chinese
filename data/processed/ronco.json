      "January 2015No one, VC or angel, has invested in more of the top startups than Ron Conway. He knows what happened in every deal in the Valley, half the time because he arranged it.And yet he's a super nice guy.",
      "In fact, nice is not the word. Ronco is good. I know of zero instances in which he has behaved badly. It's hard even to imagine.When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought \"How lucky that someone so powerful is so benevolent.\" But gradually I realized it wasn't luck.",
      "It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful. All the deals he gets to invest in come to him through referrals. Google did. Facebook did. Twitter was a referral from Evan Williams himself.",
      "And the reason so many people refer deals to him is that he's proven himself to be a good guy.Good does not mean being a pushover. I would not want to face an angry Ronco. But if Ron's angry at you, it's because you did something wrong.",
      "Ron is so old school he's Old Testament. He will smite you in his just wrath, but there's no malice in it.In almost every domain there are advantages to seeming good. It makes people trust you. But actually being good is an expensive way to seem good.",
      "To an amoral person it might seem to be overkill.In some fields it might be, but apparently not in the startup world. Though plenty of investors are jerks, there is a clear trend among them: the most successful investors are also the most upstanding.",
      "[1]It was not always this way. I would not feel confident saying that about investors twenty years ago.What changed? The startup world became more transparent and more unpredictable. Both make it harder to seem good without actually being good.It's obvious why transparency has that effect.",
      "When an investor maltreats a founder now, it gets out. Maybe not all the way to the press, but other founders hear about it, and that investor starts to lose deals. [2]The effect of unpredictability is more subtle.",
      "It increases the work of being inconsistent. If you're going to be two-faced, you have to know who you should be nice to and who you can get away with being nasty to. In the startup world, things change so rapidly that you can't tell.",
      "The random college kid you talk to today might in a couple years be the CEO of the hottest startup in the Valley. If you can't tell who to be nice to, you have to be nice to everyone. And probably the only people who can manage that are the people who are genuinely good.In a sufficiently connected and unpredictable world, you can't seem good without being good.As often happens, Ron discovered how to be the investor of the future by accident.",
      "He didn't foresee the future of startup investing, realize it would pay to be upstanding, and force himself to behave that way. It would feel unnatural to him to behave any other way. He was already living in the future.Fortunately that future is not limited to the startup world.",
      "The startup world is more transparent and unpredictable than most, but almost everywhere the trend is in that direction.Notes[1] I'm not saying that if you sort investors by benevolence you've also sorted them by returns, but rather that if you do a scatterplot with benevolence on the x axis and returns on the y, you'd see a clear upward trend.[2] Y Combinator in particular, because it aggregates data from so many startups, has a pretty comprehensive view of investor behavior.",

      "translated": "2015年1月，没有人，无论是风险投资人还是天使投资人，在顶尖的初创企业中投资得比Ron Conway更多。他对硅谷发生的每一笔交易了如指掌，很多时候是因为这些交易是他促成的。然而，他却是一个非常和蔼的人。"

      "translated": "事实上，“好”这个词还不足以形容。Ronco 很出色。我从未见过他有任何不当行为。甚至很难想象他会那样做。我刚到硅谷时，心想：“真幸运，有这么一位如此仁慈的权势人物。”但后来我逐渐意识到，这并不是运气。"

      "translated": "罗恩如此传统，以至于他是旧约式的。他会以正义的愤怒惩罚你，但这并非出于恶意。在几乎所有的领域，显得善良都有其优势。这会让人信任你。但真正善良却是显得善良的一种昂贵方式。"

      "translated": "对于一个没有道德观念的人来说，这可能显得过于严苛。在某些领域确实如此，但在创业世界里显然并非如此。尽管许多投资者都是混蛋，但其中有一个明显的趋势：最成功的投资者同时也是最正直的。"

      "translated": "[1]情况并非一直如此。对于二十年前的投资者，我不会有这样的信心。发生了什么变化？创业世界的透明度增加，同时变得更加不可预测。这两者都使得在不真正优秀的情况下显得优秀变得更加困难。透明度为何会有这样的效果，这是显而易见的。"

      "translated": "今天你交谈的任意一个大学生，几年后可能就会成为硅谷最热门初创公司的首席执行官。如果你分辨不出该对谁友好，那就必须对每个人都友好。而能够做到这一点的，大概只有那些真正善良的人。在一个足够互联且不可预测的世界里，你无法仅仅表面看起来善良而不真正善良。正如经常发生的那样，罗恩偶然发现了如何成为未来的投资者。"

      "translated": "他没有预见到初创企业投资的未来，也没有意识到做个正直的人会带来回报，更没有强迫自己这样做。对他来说，以其他方式行事会显得不自然。他早已生活在未来。幸运的是，这个未来并不局限于初创企业界。"
