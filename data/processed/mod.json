      "December 2019There are two distinct ways to be politically moderate: on purpose and by accident. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately choosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left.",
      "Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and far left are roughly equally wrong.You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the distribution of their opinions.",
      "If the far left opinion on some matter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate's opinion on every question will be near 50. Whereas an accidental moderate's opinions will be scattered over a broad range, but will, like those of the intentional moderate, average to about 50.Intentional moderates are similar to those on the far left and the far right in that their opinions are, in a sense, not their own.",
      "The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the right, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. You don't get to pick and choose. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from your opinions about sex.",
      "And although intentional moderates might seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though in their case the word \"positions\" might be more accurate) are also acquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left, the intentional moderate must shift with it.",
      "Otherwise they stop being moderate.Accidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their own answers, but choose their own questions. They may not care at all about questions that the left and right both think are terribly important.",
      "So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and those the left and right care about, and this can sometimes be vanishingly small.It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say \"if you're not with us, you're against us,\" but often simply false.Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by the extreme left.",
      "But while it may be accurate to call intentional moderates cowards, openly being an accidental moderate requires the most courage of all, because you get attacked from both right and left, and you don't have the comfort of being an orthodox member of a large group to sustain you.Nearly all the most impressive people I know are accidental moderates.",
      "If I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainment business, that might be different. Being on the far left or far right doesn't affect how fast you run or how well you sing. But someone who works with ideas has to be independent-minded to do it well.Or more precisely, you have to be independent-minded about the ideas you work with.",
      "You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics and still be a good mathematician. In the 20th century, a lot of very smart people were Marxists — just no one who was smart about the subjects Marxism involves.",
      "But if the ideas you use in your work intersect with the politics of your time, you have two choices: be an accidental moderate, or be mediocre.Notes[1] It's possible in theory for one side to be entirely right and the other to be entirely wrong.",
      "Indeed, ideologues must always believe this is the case. But historically it rarely has been.[2] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather than despise them as backsliders. I'm not sure why.",
      "Perhaps it means that the far right is less ideological than the far left. Or perhaps that they are more confident, or more resigned, or simply more disorganized. I just don't know.[3] Having heretical opinions doesn't mean you have to express them openly.",
      "It may be easier to have them if you don't. Thanks to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Amjad Masad, Ryan Petersen, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.Japanese Translation"

      "translated": "2019年12月 有两种明显不同的方式可以成为政治上的温和派：有意为之和偶然为之。有意的温和派是调和者，故意选择在右翼和左翼极端之间的中间立场。"

      "translated": "偶然的温和派最终处于中间位置，平均而言，是因为他们对每个问题都有自己的判断，而极右和极左的观点大致都是错误的。可以通过他们意见的分布来区分有意的温和派和偶然的温和派。"

      "translated": "如果某个问题上的最左意见是0，最右意见是100，那么有意保持中立的人在每个问题上的意见都会接近50。而偶然的中立者的意见则会分散在一个较宽的范围内，但与有意保持中立者一样，平均下来也约为50。有意保持中立的人与最左和最右的人相似之处在于，他们的意见在某种意义上来说，并非完全出自自身。"

      "translated": "意识形态者，无论是左派还是右派，其本质特征是成批地接受自己的观点。你无法挑三拣四。你对税收的看法可以从你对性别的看法中预测出来。"

      "translated": "尽管有意保持中立的人看似与意识形态者截然相反，但他们的观点（在这种情况下，用“立场”一词可能更为准确）也是成批获得的。如果中位意见向右或向左偏移，有意保持中立的人也必须随之调整。"

      "translated": "因此，你只能从他们关心的问题与左右两派关心的问题的交集中来衡量一个偶然的温和派的政治立场，而这个交集有时会小到几乎不存在。说“如果你不和我们站在一起，你就是反对我们”不仅是一种操纵性的修辞手法，而且往往纯粹是错误的。温和派有时会被极端左派嘲笑为胆小鬼。"

      "translated": "但虽然称有意的温和派为胆小鬼可能是准确的，但公开成为无意的温和派却需要最大的勇气，因为你同时会受到左右两方的攻击，而且你没有大团体正统成员的舒适感来支撑你。我认识的几乎所有最令人印象深刻的人都属于无意的温和派。"

      "translated": "如果我认识很多职业运动员或娱乐界的人士，情况可能会有所不同。立场偏左或偏右不会影响你的跑步速度或唱歌水平。但对于从事思想工作的人来说，要有独立思考的能力才能做好。或者更准确地说，对于你所处理的思想，你必须有独立的思考能力。"
