      "translated": "“新手”这个词肯定不是什么恭维。然而，今天我意识到作为一名新手也有令人鼓舞的一面：你在某个地方越是个新手，你在全球范围内就越不是新手。例如，如果你待在自己的国家，你会觉得自己不如搬到法拉瓦维亚（Farawavia）那样是个新手，因为在法拉瓦维亚一切都运作得不同。"

      "translated": "然而，当你行动时，你会了解更多。所以，感觉自己是新手的感觉与实际的无知是成反比的。但如果我们觉得新手的感觉对我们有好处，为什么我们却不喜欢这种感觉呢？这种厌恶感在进化上有什么作用呢？我认为答案是，感觉像新手的来源有两个：一是自己笨，二是做某件新奇的事情。"

      "translated": "我们不喜欢感觉自己像新手，这是我们的大脑在告诉我们“快点，快点，把这些弄明白。”在人类历史的大部分时间里，这种思维方式是正确的。狩猎采集者的生活很复杂，但不像现在的生活变化那么快。"
