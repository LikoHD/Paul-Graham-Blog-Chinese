      "Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. January 2012A year ago I noticed a pattern in the least successful startups we'd funded: they all seemed hard to talk to. It felt as if there was some kind of wall between us.",
      "I could never quite tell if they understood what I was saying.This caught my attention because earlier we'd noticed a pattern among the most successful startups, and it seemed to hinge on a different quality.",
      "We found the startups that did best were the ones with the sort of founders about whom we'd say \"they can take care of themselves.\" The startups that do best are fire-and-forget in the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and they'll close it, whatever type of lead it is.",
      "When they're raising money, for example, you can do the initial intros knowing that if you wanted to you could stop thinking about it at that point. You won't have to babysit the round to make sure it happens.",
      "That type of founder is going to come back with the money; the only question is how much on what terms.It seemed odd that the outliers at the two ends of the spectrum could be detected by what appeared to be unrelated tests.",
      "You'd expect that if the founders at one end were distinguished by the presence of quality x, at the other end they'd be distinguished by lack of x. Was there some kind of inverse relation between resourcefulness and being hard to talk to?It turns out there is, and the key to the mystery is the old adage \"a word to the wise is sufficient.\" Because this phrase is not only overused, but overused in an indirect way (by prepending the subject to some advice), most people who've heard it don't know what it means.",
      "What it means is that if someone is wise, all you have to do is say one word to them, and they'll understand immediately. You don't have to explain in detail; they'll chase down all the implications.In much the same way that all you have to do is give the right sort of founder a one line intro to a VC, and he'll chase down the money.",
      "That's the connection. Understanding all the implications — even the inconvenient implications — of what someone tells you is a subset of resourcefulness. It's conversational resourcefulness.Like real world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulness often means doing things you don't want to.",
      "Chasing down all the implications of what's said to you can sometimes lead to uncomfortable conclusions. The best word to describe the failure to do so is probably \"denial,\" though that seems a bit too narrow.",
      "A better way to describe the situation would be to say that the unsuccessful founders had the sort of conservatism that comes from weakness. They traversed idea space as gingerly as a very old person traverses the physical world.",
      "[1]The unsuccessful founders weren't stupid. Intellectually they were as capable as the successful founders of following all the implications of what one said to them. They just weren't eager to.So being hard to talk to was not what was killing the unsuccessful startups.",
      "It was a sign of an underlying lack of resourcefulness. That's what was killing them. As well as failing to chase down the implications of what was said to them, the unsuccessful founders would also fail to chase down funding, and users, and sources of new ideas.",
      "But the most immediate evidence I had that something was amiss was that I couldn't talk to them.Notes[1] A YC partner wrote:My feeling with the bad groups is that coming into office hours, they've already decided what they're going to do and everything I say is being put through an internal process in their heads, which either desperately tries to munge what I've said into something that conforms with their decision or just outright dismisses it and creates a rationalization for doing so.",
      "They may not even be conscious of this process but that's what I think is happening when you say something to bad groups and they have that glazed over look. I don't think it's confusion or lack of understanding per se, it's this internal process at work.With the good groups, you can tell that everything you say is being looked at with fresh eyes and even if it's dismissed, it's because of some logical reason e.g.",
      "\"we already tried that\" or \"from speaking to our users that isn't what they'd like,\" etc. Those groups never have that glazed over look.Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Aaron Iba, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this."

      "translated": "想创办一家初创公司吗？那就获得Y Combinator的投资吧。2012年1月，一年前我注意到我们资助的最不成功的初创公司有一个共同点：与它们沟通似乎很困难。感觉好像我们之间存在某种障碍。"

      "translated": "我始终无法确定他们是否理解我在说什么。这引起了我的注意，因为之前我们发现成功创业公司中存在一个模式，似乎关键在于另一种品质。"

      "translated": "我们发现表现最好的初创公司是那些我们可以说“他们能够自力更生”的创始人创办的。表现最好的初创公司在某种意义上是“发射后不管”的，因为只要你给他们一个线索，他们就能将其转化为成果，无论是什么类型的线索。"

      "translated": "那种创始人肯定会带着资金回来；唯一的问题是，在什么条件下，能带回来多少。看起来很奇怪，两端的极端案例竟然可以通过看似无关的测试来识别。"

      "translated": "你可能会认为，如果一端的创始人因具备特质X而与众不同，那么另一端的创始人则因缺乏特质X而与众不同。是否有一种反比关系存在于足智多谋和难以沟通之间？事实证明确实存在，解开这个谜团的关键在于一句古老的格言：“智者一言足以。”因为这句话不仅被过度使用，而且是以一种间接的方式使用（在给出建议前加上主体），所以大多数听过这句话的人并不知道它的真正含义。"

      "translated": "这意味着，如果一个人有智慧，你只需要对他讲一个词，他就能马上理解。你不必详加解释，他会追根究底地理解所有含义。同样地，你只需要给合适的创始人一句话的介绍给风险投资家，他就能去争取到资金。"

      "translated": "这就是关联。理解某人告诉你的所有含义——甚至是那些令人不快的含义——是机敏的一部分。这是对话中的机敏。就像现实中的机敏一样，对话中的机敏往往意味着做你不想做的事情。"

      "translated": "[1]不成功的创始人并不愚蠢。他们在智力上和成功的创始人一样，能够理解别人对他们所说的一切含义。他们只是不愿意这样做。所以，难以沟通并不是导致不成功创业公司失败的原因。"

      "translated": "这是一种资源匮乏的根本迹象。这才是致命的问题。除了未能深入探究他人话语中的含义外，这些不成功的创业者还未能积极寻求资金、用户和新想法的来源。"

      "translated": "但最直接的证据是我无法与他们沟通。注[1] 一位YC合伙人写道：我对那些表现不佳的团队的感觉是，他们在来办公时间之前就已经决定了要做什么，我所说的一切都会经过他们内心的过滤，要么拼命地将我的话扭曲成符合他们决定的东西，要么直接-dismisses-并为此创造一个合理的解释。"

      "translated": "他们可能甚至没有意识到这个过程，但当你对不良团体说些什么，而他们露出茫然的眼神时，我认为这就是正在发生的事情。我认为这并不是因为困惑或理解不了，而是内在的处理机制在起作用。对于好的团体，你可以感觉到他们用全新的眼光看待你说的每一句话，即便他们否定了某些观点，那也是基于某种合理的理由，例如："
