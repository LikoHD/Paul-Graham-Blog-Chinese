      "August 2005Thirty years ago, one was supposed to work one's way up the corporate ladder. That's less the rule now. Our generation wants to get paid up front. Instead of developing a product for some big company in the expectation of getting job security in return, we develop the product ourselves, in a startup, and sell it to the big company.",
      "At the very least we want options.Among other things, this shift has created the appearance of a rapid increase in economic inequality. But really the two cases are not as different as they look in economic statistics.Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value of safe jobs.",
      "An easy job from which one can't be fired is worth money; exchanging the two is one of the commonest forms of corruption. A sinecure is, in effect, an annuity. Except sinecures don't appear in economic statistics.",
      "If they did, it would be clear that in practice socialist countries have nontrivial disparities of wealth, because they usually have a class of powerful bureaucrats who are paid mostly by seniority and can never be fired.While not a sinecure, a position on the corporate ladder was genuinely valuable, because big companies tried not to fire people, and promoted from within based largely on seniority.",
      "A position on the corporate ladder had a value analogous to the \"goodwill\" that is a very real element in the valuation of companies. It meant one could expect future high paying jobs.One of main causes of the decay of the corporate ladder is the trend for takeovers that began in the 1980s.",
      "Why waste your time climbing a ladder that might disappear before you reach the top?And, by no coincidence, the corporate ladder was one of the reasons the early corporate raiders were so successful.",
      "It's not only economic statistics that ignore the value of safe jobs. Corporate balance sheets do too. One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s companies and sell them for parts was that they hadn't formally acknowledged their implicit debt to employees who had done good work and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive jobs when their time came.In the movie Wall Street, Gordon Gekko ridicules a company overloaded with vice presidents.",
      "But the company may not be as corrupt as it seems; those VPs' cushy jobs were probably payment for work done earlier.I like the new model better. For one thing, it seems a bad plan to treat jobs as rewards.",
      "Plenty of good engineers got made into bad managers that way. And the old system meant people had to deal with a lot more corporate politics, in order to protect the work they'd invested in a position on the ladder.The big disadvantage of the new system is that it involves more risk.",
      "If you develop ideas in a startup instead of within a big company, any number of random factors could sink you before you can finish. But maybe the older generation would laugh at me for saying that the way we do things is riskier.",
      "After all, projects within big companies were always getting cancelled as a result of arbitrary decisions from higher up. My father's entire industry (breeder reactors) disappeared that way.For better or worse, the idea of the corporate ladder is probably gone for good.",
      "The new model seems more liquid, and more efficient. But it is less of a change, financially, than one might think. Our fathers weren't that stupid.Romanian TranslationJapanese Translation"

      "translated": "2005年8月 三十年前，人们预期是逐步晋升企业阶梯。现在这种情况越来越少。我们这一代人希望先拿到报酬。我们不再为了换取工作保障而为大公司开发产品，而是自己在创业公司开发产品，然后卖给大公司。"

      "translated": "至少我们希望有选择。除此之外，这种转变还造成了经济不平等迅速加剧的表象。但实际上，这两种情况在经济统计数据中的差异并没有看起来那么大。经济统计数据具有误导性，因为它们忽略了安全工作的价值。"

      "translated": "如果真是这样，那么实际上社会主义国家中存在非微不足道的财富差距就显而易见了，因为这些国家通常有一批权力很大的官员，他们的薪酬主要基于资历，而且永远不会被解雇。虽然这并不是一个轻松的职位，但在这个企业阶梯上的位置确实是有价值的，因为大公司通常尽量不裁员，并且主要根据资历从内部提拔员工。"

      "translated": "在企业阶梯上的位置具有一种类似于“商誉”的价值，而商誉是公司估值中一个非常真实的要素。这意味着可以期待未来获得高薪职位。企业阶梯衰落的主要原因之一是始于20世纪80年代的并购趋势。"

      "translated": "不仅经济统计数据忽略了安全工作的价值，企业资产负债表也是如此。上世纪80年代企业被分割并出售的原因之一是，这些企业没有正式承认对那些工作表现良好并期望在适当时候获得高薪高管职位的员工所承担的隐性债务。在电影《华尔街》中，戈登·盖柯嘲笑了一家副总裁过多的公司。"
