      "January 2007(Foreword to Jessica Livingston's Founders at Work.)Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the blocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down. The winners slow down the least.",
      "It's that way with most startups too. The earliest phase is usually the most productive. That's when they have the really big ideas. Imagine what Apple was like when 100% of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.The striking thing about this phase is that it's completely different from most people's idea of what business is like.",
      "If you looked in people's heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing \"business,\" you'd get images of people dressed up in suits, groups sitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint presentations, people producing thick reports for one another to read.",
      "Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this. And yet they're probably the most productive part of the whole economy.Why the disconnect? I think there's a general principle at work here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they expend on appearances to compensate.",
      "More often than not the energy they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance worse. A few years ago I read an article in which a car magazine modified the \"sports\" model of some production car to get the fastest possible standing quarter mile.",
      "You know how they did it? They cut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car to make it look fast.Business is broken the same way that car was. The effort that goes into looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes organizations less productive.",
      "Suits, for example. Suits do not help people to think better. I bet most executives at big companies do their best thinking when they wake up on Sunday morning and go downstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee.",
      "That's when you have ideas. Just imagine what a company would be like if people could think that well at work. People do in startups, at least some of the time. (Half the time you're in a panic because your servers are on fire, but the other half you're thinking as deeply as most people only get to sitting alone on a Sunday morning.)Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and what passes for productivity in big companies.",
      "And yet conventional ideas of professionalism have such an iron grip on our minds that even startup founders are affected by them. In our startup, when outsiders came to visit we tried hard to seem \"professional.\" We'd clean up our offices, wear better clothes, try to arrange that a lot of people were there during conventional office hours.",
      "In fact, programming didn't get done by well-dressed people at clean desks during office hours. It got done by badly dressed people (I was notorious for programmming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn with junk at 2 in the morning.",
      "But no visitor would understand that. Not even investors, who are supposed to be able to recognize real productivity when they see it. Even we were affected by the conventional wisdom. We thought of ourselves as impostors, succeeding despite being totally unprofessional.",
      "It was as if we'd created a Formula 1 car but felt sheepish because it didn't look like a car was supposed to look.In the car world, there are at least some people who know that a high performance car looks like a Formula 1 racecar, not a sedan with giant rims and a fake spoiler bolted to the trunk.",
      "Why not in business? Probably because startups are so small. The really dramatic growth happens when a startup only has three or four people, so only three or four people see that, whereas tens of thousands see business as it's practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris.This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, till now, only a handful people got to see: what happens in the first year of a startup.",
      "This is what real productivity looks like. This is the Formula 1 racecar. It looks weird, but it goes fast.Of course, big companies won't be able to do everything these startups do. In big companies there's always going to be more politics, and less scope for individual decisions.",
      "But seeing what startups are really like will at least show other organizations what to aim for. The time may soon be coming when instead of startups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try to seem more like startups.",
      "That would be a good thing. Japanese Translation Founders at WorkThere can't be more than a couple thousand people who know first-hand what happens in the first month of a successful startup. Jessica Livingston got them to tell us.",
      "So despite the interview format, this is really a how-to book. It is probably the single most valuable book a startup founder could read."

      "translated": "大多数初创公司也是如此。最早期通常是生产力最高的时期。那时他们会有真正的大想法。想象一下当苹果公司的所有员工都是史蒂夫·乔布斯或史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克时的情景。这个阶段最引人注目的是，它与大多数人对商业的看法完全不同。"

      "translated": "早期的创业公司正好相反。然而，它们可能是整个经济中最富有生产力的部分。为什么会有这种脱节？我认为这里有一个普遍的原则在起作用：人们在表现上花费的精力越少，为了补偿就会在表面上花费更多的精力。"

      "translated": "通常，他们在试图显得令人印象深刻上所花费的精力反而使他们的实际表现变得更差。几年前，我读过一篇文章，一家汽车杂志对某款量产车的“运动”型号进行了改装，以达到最快的0到400米加速成绩。"

      "translated": "你知道他们是怎么做的吗？他们把制造商为了使汽车看起来更快而安装的所有多余部件都拆掉了。商业也是如此，和那辆车一样被破坏了。用于表面上看起来高效的努力不仅是浪费，实际上还使组织变得更低效。"

      "translated": "那时你就会有想法。想象一下，如果人们在工作中也能如此思考，公司会是什么样子。在初创公司里，人们确实能做到，至少有时是这样。（一半的时间你因为服务器着火而恐慌，但另一半时间，你的思考深度就像大多数人只有在周日清晨独自坐着时才能达到的那样。）对于初创公司与大公司所谓的生产力之间的大多数其他差异，也是如此。"

      "translated": "然而，传统的专业观念在我们的思想中根深蒂固，以至于就连初创企业的创始人也受到了影响。在我们的初创公司，当外来访客来参观时，我们竭力表现出“专业”的一面。我们会打扫办公室，穿上更好的衣服，尽量安排在正常办公时间有更多的人在场。"

      "translated": "事实上，编程工作并不是由那些穿着得体的人在干净的办公桌前的办公时间完成的。而是由那些穿着邋遢的人（我以仅披着浴巾编程而闻名）在凌晨两点的、满是杂物的办公室里完成的。"

      "translated": "这就像我们制造了一辆一级方程式赛车，却因为它的外观不像传统汽车而感到羞愧。在汽车界，至少有些人知道，高性能汽车看起来应该像一级方程式赛车，而不是装有大轮毂和假扰流板的轿车。"

      "translated": "为什么在商业领域不是这样？可能是因为初创公司规模太小了。初创公司最显著的增长发生在只有三到四个人的时候，所以只有三到四个人能见证这一过程，而数万人则能看到波音或菲利普莫里斯这样的大公司是如何运作的。这本书可以帮助解决这个问题，通过向所有人展示迄今为止只有少数人能看到的场景：初创公司在第一年里发生了什么。"

      "translated": "这才是真正的生产力。这就是一级方程式赛车。它看起来奇怪，但速度极快。当然，大公司不可能做到这些初创公司所做的一切。在大公司里，总会存在更多的政治斗争，个人决策的空间也会更小。"
