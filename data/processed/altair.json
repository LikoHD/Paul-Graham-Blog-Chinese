      "These ideas didn't just seem small. They seemed wrong. They were the kind of ideas you could not merely ignore, but ridicule.Often the founders themselves didn't know why their ideas were promising. They were attracted to these ideas by instinct, because they were living in the future and they sensed that something was missing.",
      "But they could not have put into words exactly how their ugly ducklings were going to grow into big, beautiful swans.Most people's first impulse when they hear about a lame-sounding new startup idea is to make fun of it.",

      "Sometimes I can't think of an answer, especially when the idea is a made-up one. But it's remarkable how often there does turn out to be an answer. Often it's one the founders themselves hadn't seen yet.Intriguingly, there are sometimes multiple answers.",
      "I talked to a startup a few days ago that could grow into 3 distinct Microsofts. They'd probably vary in size by orders of magnitude. But you can never predict how big a Microsoft is going to be, so in cases like that I encourage founders to follow whichever path is most immediately exciting to them.",

      "translated": "因为一开始它们几乎都显得不起眼。不仅仅是规模小，不起眼。不仅仅是在攀登高山时迈出的第一步。更像是踏入沼泽的第一步。为阿尔泰计算机编写的基本解释器？这怎么可能发展成一家大公司？"

      "translated": "这些想法不仅仅是显得微不足道，而是显得错误。它们是那种你不仅不能置之不理，反而会嘲笑的想法。通常，就连创始人自己也不清楚为什么他们的想法有潜力。他们凭着直觉被这些想法所吸引，因为他们生活在未来的时空中，感觉到有些东西缺失了。"
