      "October 2022If there were intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they'd share certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematics would be the same, because they're true by definition.",
      "Ditto for the truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same on their planet. But I think we'd share other truths with aliens besides the truths of math and physics, and that it would be worthwhile to think about what these might be.For example, I think we'd share the principle that a controlled experiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionally increased belief in it.",
      "It seems fairly likely, too, that it would be true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing. We'd probably share Occam's razor. There doesn't seem anything specifically human about any of these ideas.We can only guess, of course.",
      "We can't say for sure what forms intelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that question, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien truth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms intelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or more precisely a target, for truth.",
      "If you're trying to find the most general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably they'll be those we'd share in common with other forms of intelligent life.Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side of generosity.",
      "If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that's enough. Justice, for example. I wouldn't want to bet that all intelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but I wouldn't want to bet against it either.The idea of alien truth is related to Erdos's idea of God's book.",
      "He used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God's book, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was more discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be universally recognized.",
      "If there's such a thing as alien truth, then there's more in God's book than math.What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice is \"philosophy.\" Whatever else philosophy includes, it should probably include this.",
      "I'm fairly sure Aristotle would have thought so. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth is, if not an accurate description of philosophy, a good definition for it. I.e. that it's what people who call themselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currently are.",
      "But I'm not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not what we call it.We may one day have something like alien life among us in the form of AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about what truths an intelligent being would have to share with us.",
      "We might find, for example, that it's impossible to create something we'd consider intelligent that doesn't use Occam's razor. We might one day even be able to prove that. But though this sort of research would be very interesting, it's not necessary for our purposes, or even the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we're going to call it that, would be to see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target, not to say precisely where the threshold of it is.",
      "Those two questions might one day converge, but they'll converge from quite different directions, and till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselves to thinking only about things we're certain would be alien truths.",
      "Especially since this will probably be one of those areas where the best guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let's see if that one does.)Whatever we call it, the attempt to discover alien truths would be a worthwhile undertaking.",
      "And curiously enough, that is itself probably an alien truth.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Greg Brockman, Patrick Collison, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this."

      "translated": "同样的道理也适用于物理定律；碳原子的质量在他们的星球上也会是相同的。但我认为，除了数学和物理的真理之外，我们还会与外星人共享其他真理，思考这些真理可能是什么是值得的。例如，我认为我们会共享这样一个原则：对某个假设进行受控实验测试，使我们有权相应地增加对该假设的信任。"

      "translated": "我们不能确定智能生命可能采取的形式。尽管这个问题很有趣，但在这里探索它并不是我的目的。外星真理这一概念的重点不在于它为我们提供了一种推测智能生命可能形式的方式，而在于它为我们提供了一个门槛，或者更准确地说，是一个真理的目标。"

      "translated": "如果你试图寻找那些仅次于数学或物理学的最普遍的真理，那么这些真理很可能是我们与其他形式的智能生命所共有的。外星真理作为启发式方法最有效时，我们应该倾向于慷慨。"

      "translated": "如果一个想法可能与外星人相关，那就足够了。比如正义。我不会打赌所有智能生物都会理解正义的概念，但我也不会打赌它们不会。外星真理的概念与埃尔德什关于上帝之书的想法有关。"

      "translated": "例如，我们可能会发现，不可能创造出不使用奥卡姆剃刀原则的我们认为是智能的东西。有一天我们甚至可能能够证明这一点。但尽管这类研究会非常有趣，但它对于我们来说并不是必要的，甚至不属于同一领域；如果我们称之为哲学的话，其目标应该是以异类真理为目标，看看我们能提出什么想法，而不是精确地界定其门槛在哪里。"
