      "April 2007There are two different ways people judge you. Sometimes judging you correctly is the end goal. But there's a second much more common type of judgement where it isn't. We tend to regard all judgements of us as the first type.",
      "We'd probably be happier if we realized which are and which aren't.The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end goal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions.",
      "Such judgements can of course be mistaken, but because the goal is to judge you correctly, there's usually some kind of appeals process. If you feel you've been misjudged, you can protest that you've been treated unfairly.Nearly all the judgements made on children are of this type, so we get into the habit early in life of thinking that all judgements are.But in fact there is a second much larger class of judgements where judging you is only a means to something else.",
      "These include college admissions, hiring and investment decisions, and of course the judgements made in dating. This kind of judgement is not really about you.Put yourself in the position of someone selecting players for a national team.",
      "Suppose for the sake of simplicity that this is a game with no positions, and that you have to select 20 players. There will be a few stars who clearly should make the team, and many players who clearly shouldn't.",
      "The only place your judgement makes a difference is in the borderline cases. Suppose you screw up and underestimate the 20th best player, causing him not to make the team, and his place to be taken by the 21st best.",
      "You've still picked a good team. If the players have the usual distribution of ability, the 21st best player will be only slightly worse than the 20th best. Probably the difference between them will be less than the measurement error.The 20th best player may feel he has been misjudged.",
      "But your goal here wasn't to provide a service estimating people's ability. It was to pick a team, and if the difference between the 20th and 21st best players is less than the measurement error, you've still done that optimally.It's a false analogy even to use the word unfair to describe this kind of misjudgement.",
      "It's not aimed at producing a correct estimate of any given individual, but at selecting a reasonably optimal set.One thing that leads us astray here is that the selector seems to be in a position of power.",
      "That makes him seem like a judge. If you regard someone judging you as a customer instead of a judge, the expectation of fairness goes away. The author of a good novel wouldn't complain that readers were unfair for preferring a potboiler with a racy cover.",
      "Stupid, perhaps, but not unfair.Our early training and our self-centeredness combine to make us believe that every judgement of us is about us. In fact most aren't. This is a rare case where being less self-centered will make people more confident.",
      "Once you realize how little most people judging you care about judging you accurately—once you realize that because of the normal distribution of most applicant pools, it matters least to judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has the most effect—you won't take rejection so personally.And curiously enough, taking rejection less personally may help you to get rejected less often.",
      "If you think someone judging you will work hard to judge you correctly, you can afford to be passive. But the more you realize that most judgements are greatly influenced by random, extraneous factors—that most people judging you are more like a fickle novel buyer than a wise and perceptive magistrate—the more you realize you can do things to influence the outcome.One good place to apply this principle is in college applications.",
      "Most high school students applying to college do it with the usual child's mix of inferiority and self-centeredness: inferiority in that they assume that admissions committees must be all-seeing; self-centeredness in that they assume admissions committees care enough about them to dig down into their application and figure out whether they're good or not.",
      "These combine to make applicants passive in applying and hurt when they're rejected. If college applicants realized how quick and impersonal most selection processes are, they'd make more effort to sell themselves, and take the outcome less personally.Spanish TranslationRussian TranslationArabic Translation"

      "translated": "2007年4月 人们评判你的方式有两种。有时，正确地评判你是最终目的。但还有一种更为常见的评判方式，其目的并非如此。我们倾向于将所有对我们的评判都视为第一种类型。"

      "translated": "这样的判断当然可能是错误的，但因为目标是对你做出正确的判断，所以通常会有一种申诉程序。如果你觉得自己被误判了，可以抗议自己受到了不公平的对待。几乎对孩子们做出的所有判断都属于这一类，因此我们从小就开始习惯性地认为所有的判断都是这样的。但实际上，还有一类更大数量的判断，其中对你进行判断只是达到其他目的的手段。"

      "translated": "或许愚蠢，但并不不公平。我们的早期训练和自我中心主义结合在一起，使我们相信对我们的每一个评价都是关于我们自身的。事实上，大多数并不是。这是一个罕见的情况，减少自我中心主义会使人们更加自信。"

      "translated": "一旦你意识到，大多数人对你评价时其实并不在乎是否准确评价你——一旦你明白，由于大多数申请者群体的正态分布，恰恰在评价对结果影响最大的情况下，准确评价的重要性最低——你就不会把拒绝看得那么个人化了。而有趣的是，不那么个人化地看待拒绝，可能会帮助你减少被拒绝的次数。"

      "translated": "如果你认为有人评判你时会努力做出正确的判断，那么你可以选择被动。但你越意识到大多数判断都受到随机的、无关因素的极大影响——大多数评判你的人更像是善变的小说买家，而非明智而敏锐的法官——你就越会意识到你可以采取行动来影响结果。一个应用这一原则的好地方就是在大学申请中。"
