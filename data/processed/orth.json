      "July 2020 \"Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.\"— Einstein There has been a lot of talk about privilege lately.",
      "Although the concept is overused, there is something to it, and in particular to the idea that privilege makes you blind — that you can't see things that are visible to someone whose life is very different from yours.But one of the most pervasive examples of this kind of blindness is one that I haven't seen mentioned explicitly.",
      "I'm going to call it orthodox privilege: The more conventional-minded someone is, the more it seems to them that it's safe for everyone to express their opinions.It's safe for them to express their opinions, because the source of their opinions is whatever it's currently acceptable to believe.",
      "So it seems to them that it must be safe for everyone. They literally can't imagine a true statement that would get you in trouble.And yet at every point in history, there were true things that would get you in trouble to say.",
      "Is ours the first where this isn't so? What an amazing coincidence that would be.Surely it should at least be the default assumption that our time is not unique, and that there are true things you can't say now, just as there have always been.",
      "You would think. But even in the face of such overwhelming historical evidence, most people will go with their gut on this one.In the most extreme cases, people suffering from orthodox privilege will not only deny that there's anything true that you can't say, but will accuse you of heresy merely for saying there is.",
      "Though if there's more than one heresy current in your time, these accusations will be weirdly non-deterministic: you must either be an xist or a yist.Frustrating as it is to deal with these people, it's important to realize that they're in earnest.",
      "They're not pretending they think it's impossible for an idea to be both unorthodox and true. The world really looks that way to them.Indeed, this is a uniquely tenacious form of privilege. People can overcome the blindness induced by most forms of privilege by learning more about whatever they're not.",
      "But they can't overcome orthodox privilege just by learning more. They'd have to become more independent-minded. If that happens at all, it doesn't happen on the time scale of one conversation.It may be possible to convince some people that orthodox privilege must exist even though they can't sense it, just as one can with, say, dark matter.",
      "There may be some who could be convinced, for example, that it's very unlikely that this is the first point in history at which there's nothing true you can't say, even if they can't imagine specific examples.But in general I don't think it will work to say \"check your privilege\" about this type of privilege, because those in its demographic don't realize they're in it.",
      "It doesn't seem to conventional-minded people that they're conventional-minded. It just seems to them that they're right. Indeed, they tend to be particularly sure of it.Perhaps the solution is to appeal to politeness.",
      "If someone says they can hear a high-pitched noise that you can't, it's only polite to take them at their word, instead of demanding evidence that's impossible to produce, or simply denying that they hear anything.",
      "Imagine how rude that would seem. Similarly, if someone says they can think of things that are true but that cannot be said, it's only polite to take them at their word, even if you can't think of any yourself.",
      "Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Antonio Garcia-Martinez, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Michael Nielsen, Geoff Ralston, Max Roser, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this."

      "translated": "尽管这一概念被过度使用，但它确实有其道理，特别是关于特权使你盲目这一观点——你无法看到那些与你生活截然不同的人所看到的事情。但最普遍的一种这种盲目的例子，是我没有看到被明确提及过的。"

      "translated": "我将其称为正统特权：一个人越是思想传统，就越觉得每个人表达自己观点是安全的。他们表达自己观点是安全的，因为他们的观点来源正是当前被普遍接受的信仰。"

      "translated": "这难道是第一次出现这种情况吗？如果真是这样，那可真是个惊人的巧合。当然，我们至少应该假设我们的时代并不独特，总有一些真相现在无法言说，就像过去一直如此一样。"

      "translated": "你可能会这么想。但即使面对如此压倒性的历史证据，大多数人还是会凭直觉行事。在最极端的情况下，那些享有正统特权的人不仅会否认存在任何不能说的真实事物，甚至会因为你声称有这种事物而指责你异端。"

      "translated": "他们并不是假装认为一个观点不可能既非正统又正确。对他们来说，世界就是这样。事实上，这是一种特别顽固的特权形式。人们可以通过更多地了解自己所不了解的事物，来克服大多数特权形式所导致的盲目性。"

      "translated": "但他们仅仅通过学习更多知识是无法克服正统特权的。他们必须变得更加独立思考。如果这种情况会发生，也不会在一次对话的时间尺度内发生。或许可以说服一些人，即使他们感觉不到，正统特权也确实存在，就像可以说服他们暗物质存在一样。"

      "translated": "或许有些人可以被说服，例如，认为历史上第一次出现没有真话可以说的情况是非常不可能的，即使他们无法想象具体的例子。但总的来说，我认为在这种特权问题上说“检查你的特权”是行不通的，因为属于这一群体的人并没有意识到他们自己正享有这种特权。"
