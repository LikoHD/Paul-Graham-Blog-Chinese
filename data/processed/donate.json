      "March 2021The secret curse of the nonprofit world is restricted donations. If you haven't been involved with nonprofits, you may never have heard this phrase before. But if you have been, it probably made you wince.Restricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what can be done with the money.",
      "This is common with big donations, perhaps the default. And yet it's usually a bad idea. Usually the way the donor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would have chosen. Otherwise there would have been no need to restrict the donation.",
      "But who has a better understanding of where money needs to be spent, the nonprofit or the donor?If a nonprofit doesn't understand better than its donors where money needs to be spent, then it's incompetent and you shouldn't be donating to it at all.Which means a restricted donation is inherently suboptimal.",
      "It's either a donation to a bad nonprofit, or a donation for the wrong things.There are a couple exceptions to this principle. One is when the nonprofit is an umbrella organization. It's reasonable to make a restricted donation to a university, for example, because a university is only nominally a single nonprofit.",
      "Another exception is when the donor actually does know as much as the nonprofit about where money needs to be spent. The Gates Foundation, for example, has specific goals and often makes restricted donations to individual nonprofits to accomplish them.",
      "But unless you're a domain expert yourself or donating to an umbrella organization, your donation would do more good if it were unrestricted.If restricted donations do less good than unrestricted ones, why do donors so often make them?",
      "Partly because doing good isn't donors' only motive. They often have other motives as well — to make a mark, or to generate good publicity [1], or to comply with regulations or corporate policies. Many donors may simply never have considered the distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations.",
      "They may believe that donating money for some specific purpose is just how donation works. And to be fair, nonprofits don't try very hard to discourage such illusions. They can't afford to. People running nonprofits are almost always anxious about money.",
      "They can't afford to talk back to big donors.You can't expect candor in a relationship so asymmetric. So I'll tell you what nonprofits wish they could tell you. If you want to donate to a nonprofit, donate unrestricted.",
      "If you trust them to spend your money, trust them to decide how. Note[1] Unfortunately restricted donations tend to generate more publicity than unrestricted ones. \"X donates money to build a school in Africa\" is not only more interesting than \"X donates money to Y nonprofit to spend as Y chooses,\" but also focuses more attention on X.",

      "translated": "2021年3月 非营利组织世界的秘密诅咒是限定捐赠。如果你没有参与过非营利组织，你可能从未听说过这个术语。但如果你有，它可能让你感到不安。限定捐赠指的是捐赠者限制了资金使用范围的捐赠。"

      "translated": "这在大额捐赠中很常见，也许是默认的做法。然而，这通常是一个糟糕的主意。通常，捐赠者希望资金的使用方式并不是非营利组织本会选择的方式。否则，就没有必要限制捐赠的用途了。"

      "translated": "但是，谁更了解资金应该投向哪里，是非营利组织还是捐赠者？如果非营利组织不如其捐赠者更了解资金应该投向哪里，那么它就是无能的，根本就不应该向它捐款。这意味着，限定用途的捐款本质上是次优的。"

      "translated": "要么是向不好的非营利组织捐款，要么是捐款用于不当的事情。这一原则有几个例外。其中一个例外是当非营利组织是一个伞形组织时。例如，向大学捐款时指定用途是合理的，因为大学名义上只是一个单一的非营利组织。"
